## Silent Night
Silent night is a small game I am making for the [Beginners Winter Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/beginners-jam-winter-2025).

You play as a Stoccati, a cultural group that lives to make music. The Stoccati have been overthrown by the Vibratti, who despise all things musical. It is up
to you to find and return the Stoccati's sacred instrument, the "Moog". Only then can you liberate your people. But take caution, any noise you make could reveal
your intent. Tred quietly.

### Tools
- This game was made with Raylib via the Odin Programming Language
- Pixel "art" was done with Aseprite
- All audio assets were generated with the ChucK Programming Language
- Maps were simply designed with ascii characters, as you can see in assets/maps/

### Platforms 
Odin compiles binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It is indeed possible to compile for the web, but I've never done it
and I'm not sure I will have time. I hope that the transparency provided by this repo is enough to convince reviewers that the
binaries are 100% safe to download and run.
